# GCD Calculator
A program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.

## Algorithm:
  -  The program uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD.
  -  The algorithm works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the two numbers are equal.
  -  This equal value is the GCD of the original two numbers.
